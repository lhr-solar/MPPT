initialization
    local algorithm type
    stride algorithm type
    struct reference {extra context}

outside of the mppt algorithms
sensors process data
- amalgamates temperature and irradiance data
- passes it to the mppt algorithm in the following struct

struct {
    float voltageSetpoint
    float voltage {array and battery}
    float current {array and battery}
    float irradiance
    float temperature
}

global -> interruptDevice
    local
        stride
pass the struct ^ down
    return setpoint voltage
