# Python simulator for MPPT Algorithms

Created on 5/24/20 by Matthew Yu, Solar Array Lead (2020) of the UT Solar Vehicles Team.

*Consider making an actual structured repo, Matthew.*

## Dependencies

Install these dependencies or use the requirements.txt to install.
* python3

* bisect
* math
* pyqtgraph

Install dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Feature Request and Bug list
* source
  * [x] source dependence on temperature
  * [x] source dependence on irradiance
  * [ ] <del>source dependence on load</del> remove source dependence on load - this is managed by the mppt
  * [ ] load profile from some formatted file (probably csv) TODO: priority
  * [ ] load source model from some formatted file
* dc-dc converter TODO: priority
  * [ ] research simulating a dc-dc converter that converts duty cycle to v_ref TODO: priority
* mppt
  * mppt_passthrough
    * [ ] Newton's method - stride approximation leads to strong mppt oscillation
    * [ ] Piegari (Optimal) - needs to develop an accurate model function for best voltage
  * mppt_other
    * [x] PandO
    * [x] PandO variable
    * [x] dP dV feedback control mppt algo
    * [ ] fuzzy logic mppt algo
    * [ ] ripple correlation control mppt algo
    * [x] update program structure to implement default method for each mppt algorithm, then give the option of using fixed and/or optimal.
  * [ ] modify simulation to match mppt hardware convert mppt v_ref to duty cycle
* simulation
  * [ ] Profile mode: mppt power is greater than max array power by a cycle
  * [x] Save to file
* optimization
  * [x] since the model is monotonically decreasing, swap from linear search to ternary search
  * [ ] have a hashed model (perhaps loaded from a file?) of a complete IV curve for all quantized values of temperature and irradiance. Additionally, perhaps use interpolation to get curve values if temp/irrad entry does not exist.
* upgrade
  * [ ] consider the feasibility of rewriting this application in rust or C++, as there may be extensive overhead computation as source models get more expensive. **LONG TERM**
